In this repository are my custom XML files for Plex.

Currently, these include:

* an Apple TV 4K custom profile

To use a profile, you should place the XML file in the Profiles directory of your Plex Media Server's configuration files. If there is no existing Profiles folder, then you need to create it. For example, on a Synology NAS, the location of the folder should be: 

/volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Profiles

After you have placed the XML file in the Profiles folder, then you must restart Plex Media Server. Otherwise, the distribution default profile will be used.
